# plumoguSV Alt Build

Reducing popups and anything unnecessary. Fixing some bugs, adjusting the code, adding things in the future but currently primarly editing. It's a work in progress. 

Apologies if anything is poorly worded, English is current my primary language though I still suck at it. If you find anything is miss-worded/spelt lemme know.

Planned Future Updates:
- Fixing the Frames Setup bug
- Completely revamp the Tutorial menu
- Adding some more appearance options
- Change the 'Common  hotkeys:' from base hotkey inputs, to showing your hotkey inputs
- Give Lint Map the option to search only in selection
- Giving Lint Map ability delete items that are []difference, rather than only the same
- Adding More CapyBaras!! (and others)

On the back end it's just editing code stuff. Fixing bugs. Making locals more consistant with each other, for eaiser searchering. Seeing about reducing size whereever possable.
Currently, the select tab will hover a tooltip while it's not seleted, unsure about removing it or keeping it. With the Create tab I want people to explore and have a discription if they are lost, but not sure if I should keep it consistant on the Select tab. Or to keep it.
