# plumoguSV Alt Build

Reducing popups and anything unnecessary. Fixing some bugs, adjusting the code, adding things in the future but currently primarly editing. It's a work in progress. 

Apologies if anything is poorly worded, English is current my primary language though I still suck at it. If you find anything is miss-worded/spelt lemme know.


Planned Future Updates:
|Fixing the Frames Setup bug
|Completely revamp the Tutorial menu


On the back end it's just editing code stuff. Making locals more consistantly the same so it's eaiser to search through it. Seeing about trying to reduce size whereever possable.
Currently, the select tab will hover a tooltip while it's not seleted, unsure about removing it or keeping it. With the Create tab I want people to explore and have a discription if they are lost, but not sure if I should keepe it consistant on the Select tab. Or to keep it.
